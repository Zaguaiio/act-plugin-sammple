# act-plugin-sammple
First try compiling an ACT plugin

Had to do multiple things but in the end, most of the problems where finding dependencies using VS code.
Plugin code work out of the box using the ACT sample + some code obtained by other open source plugins


Saving this for now and will develop other ideas in separate repositories
